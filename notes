 - if the electric field is known on all cell edges, including those of ghost cells
   then the magnetic field can be computed everywhere. Thus faraday now need to be computed
   on the ghost box and magnetic ghosts not filled.

 - electric field ghosts are needed for:
   * particle push
   * faraday p2 and faraday corr.
     these two need Eavg to be filled on ghosts.
   * faraday p1 needs En
     this can be obtained from filling model E after corrector Ohm.
