     * @brief The IMessenger class is an interface used to communicate data between patches and
     * levels. It is used by the MultiPhysicsIntegrator and the ISolver objects. These
     * communications are of several categories:
     *
     * - initializing a level from a coarser one (done from the MultiPhysicsIntegrator)
     * - regridding, i.e. initializing a level from a former one at the same refinement level and a
     * coarser one (done from the MultiPhysicsIntegrator)
     * - filling ghost nodes from the coarser level (done by concrete ISolver objects)
     * - synchronizing quantities from the current level to the coarser one. (done by the
     * MultiPhysicsIntegrator)
     *
     * These kinds of communications are general to the evolution of a plasma hierarchy, no matter
     * the nature of the models at the fine and coarse levels in between which the messengers take
     * place.
     *
     * However, for each of these operations several quantities are concerned and their nature
     * depends on the nature of the models at the fine and coarse levels. For instance, messengers
     * of data between two MHD levels will not involve the same quantities for each of the above
     * cases as would, say, messengers of data beween two hybrid levels.
     *
     * Therefore, specializing the IMessenger interface with a concrete implementation is required
     * for each combination of (fine model, coarse model) involved in the PatchHierarchy.
     *
     * Concrete specializations are:
     * - HybridMessenger
     * - MHDMessenger
     *
     * IMessenger and subclasses exist also to hide all the SAMRAI details involved in communicating
     * data in a PatchHierarchy and to provide a simple interface to the MultiPhysicsIntegrator and
     * ISolver.
