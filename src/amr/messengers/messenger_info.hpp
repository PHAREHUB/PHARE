     * need to define its concrete specialization of the IMessengerInfo.
     *
     * * This class and its subclasses are intermediate objects between IPhysicalModel and ISolver
     * subclasses and IMessenger subclasses.
     *
     * Concrete implementations of this class are used by concrete implementations of
     * IPhysicalModel, ISolver to declare the quantities they need concrete IMessenger to deal with.
