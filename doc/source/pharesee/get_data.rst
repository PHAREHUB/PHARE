Data analysis
=============

pharesee
--------

The data produced by phare is readable with the `pharesee` python package from
the `pyphare`. Make your `PYTHONPATH` includes the directory where `pyphare` is located.

.. code-block:: bash

    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/PHARE/pyphare


Then import the `pharesee` package should work:

.. code-block:: python

    import pyphare.pharesee as pharesee



Reading the data
----------------

We will imagine a situation where you have run a simulation
for which `ElectromagDianostics` have been activated and you want to get the magnetic field. Assuming the data is in:

.. code-block:: bash

    /data/scratch/phare_jobs/run001/


The first step to get the data is to create a `Run` object, that basically represents
your simulation and will let you interact with its data.

.. code-block:: python

    from pyphare.pharesee.run import Run

    path = "/data/scratch/phare_jobs/run001/"
    run = Run(path)


Getting data is then done by calling methods of that `run` instance you just created.
Every data getters takes the same form:

.. code-block:: python

    run.GetXXX(time)

where `XXX` is the name of a physical quantity available from `pharesee`, 
and `time` is the time at which you want to get the data.

For example, to get the magnetic field at time 0.0:

.. code-block:: python

    B = run.GetB(0.0)




Python Patch Hierarchy
----------------------

Generalities
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The data read from a run most often takes the form of a `PatchHierarchy` instance.
This python object represents the hierarchy of levels of patches where the data lies.

.. code-block:: python

    B = run.GetB(0.0)  # B is a PatchHierarchy
